## Joe Thornton

I've decided to finally heed the advice I give to friends and family - become a developer.

I have worked in the following areas with varying degrees of success:
- product management in Government. SUCCESS - we got food and care to vulnerable people in lockdown.
- product management and consulting in sustainability. SOME SUCCESS - the planet is still getting hotter, but hopefully less quickly.
- finance at Procter and Gamble. SUCCESS - we sold fairy liquid at a profit.

I want to be a developer because:
- I like technical stuff and I'm technically minded (for example, I studied Engineering Science at uni)
- I like problem solving (provided it's the right problem) and I've got lots of experience at it
- I like learning and I'm told you're always learning as a developer
